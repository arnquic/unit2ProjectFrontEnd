# Unit 2 Project - TravelTime?
## Overview
An app to tell the user what to pack when they're about to go to a different city, based on the upcoming weather. The database will store the user's saved pack lists.

## Wireframes
* See 'website.drawio' and it's tabs (at the bottom of the file) for the different webpages.

## User Stories
MVP user stories
* When I navigate to the website, I can click a button to sign up or login.
* When I click the signup button, I enter in a username and password to create a profile.
* When I have logged in, I see a form to search for a city from a country.
* When I search for a city, I'm shown the following results: the city I searched, today's temperature category, a five-day history, a seven-day forecast, and suggestions for which clothes to pack on a trip there (i.e. 'the packlist').
* When I look at the search results, I have the ability to clear or save the city and packlist.
* When I click on the history link, I am shown previous cities I have searched for and saved and the corresponding packlist.
* When I'm on any page, I am able to log out via a button on the navigation bar.

Stretch Goal user stories
* When I log in, my login data is transmitted securely (i.e. with encryption and hashing).
* When I look at my saved searches, I have the ability to update the packlist according to new search results performed today.
* When I look at my suggested packlist, I can add personal items to specific packItem categories (e.g shoes > 'Nike shoes', jackets > 'blue down jacket').
* When I search for a city, the background of the page changes according to the country or region the city is in.

## Backend Routes:

## Stretch Goals
